    <h2>Research Presentations</h2>
    <p style="max-width:1000px;">The following are a small selection of my research presentations on aerospace and particle physics topics.  Being visual aids for research <i>talks</i>, please keep in mind that my verbal narration is missing.  I hope that they are reasonably clear regardless, but feel free to contact me (david.yaylali.deletethis@gmail.com) if you have any questions. </p>

        <b>&#9733; Fractional Control for Relative Orbits</b> [<a href="Talks/AAS_Maui2019_HCWFractionalControl_NoTransitions.pdf"  target="_blank">view here (1.9MB)</a>]
        <br>
        <i>Presented at the 29th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting in
Ka'anapali, HI, January 2019.</i>
        <br>
        This talk presents research on the benefits of using fractional controllers for linearized relative orbit dynamics.  I show how more optimal rendezvous trajectories, in terms of performance measures like settling time and overshoot, can be achieved.

        <b>&#9733; Fractional Consensus Control for Multiagent Systems</b> [<a href="Talks/GNC_SciTech_MultiagentFractionalControl_NoTransitions.pdf"  target="_blank">view here (3.6MB)</a>]
        <br>
        <i>Presented at the 2019 AIAA SciTech/GNC Meeting in San Diego, CA, January 2019.</i>
        <br>
        This talk outlines my research on fractional control for multiagent consensus systems.  In addition to showing the benefits of fractional controllers for multivehicle consensus, I outline the proofs of fractional controller stability for these systems.

        <b>&#9733; Monte Carlo Methods in Particle Physics... and Astrodynamics</b> [<a href="Talks/LHCMonteCarloTalk.pdf"  target="_blank">view here (8.1MB)</a>]
        <br>
        This talk was presented to Dr. Butchers GNC research group at the University of Arizona in the spring of 2017, and was given during my transition from physics to aerospace.  This talk essentially introduced aspects my previous work in particle physics to an aerospace audience, and focused on topics which I feel are useful to both fields (Monte Carlo methods).  Specifically, a large portion of this talk discusses a Python code I wrote which serves as a "LHC/particle accelerator simulator," computing expected experimental signals from new physics models.  Since particle interactions are quantum mechanical in nature, random numbers and Monte Carlo methods are especially useful.

        <b>&#9733; Low Energy Neutrinos from Dark Matter Annihilation in the Sun </b> [<a href="Talks/Pheno2016_DMmonoenergeticNeutrinos_DavidYaylali.pdf"  target="_blank">view here (2.2MB)</a>]
        <br>
        <i>Presented at the Phenomenology 2016 Symposium in Pittsburg, PA, May 2016.</i>
        <br>
        This talk presented our research on indirect searches for dark matter (DM) by looking for neutrino byproducts of DM annihilation in the Sun.  Possible annihilation channels include light quarks which will hadronize within the sun to form pions and kaons.  These pions and kaons will subsequently decay at rest within the Sun, giving a monoenergetic neutrino signal which can be detected above background at (LS/LArTPC) neutrino detectors.

        <b>&#9733; A New Direction in Dark Matter Complementarity </b> [<a href="Talks/DarkMatterPITTPACC_Workshop3.pdf"  target="_blank">view here (2.3MB)</a>]
        <br>
        <i>Presented at the PITT-PACC Dark-Matter Workshop, Pittsburg, PA, June 2014.</i>
        <br>
        This talk presented our research on non-minimal dark sectors (where dark matter comprises many different species) and new detection channels arising from this non-minimality.  (This was a large part of my PhD research.)  In the simplest case, if dark matter is made of two different species, then dark matter <i>decay</i> from the heavier to the lighter species becomes possible.  The by-products of these decays can be detectable directly, or can affect the cosmological history in observable ways.

        <b>&#9733; Astrophysical Constraints on Direct Detection</b> [<a href="Talks/DarkMatterTalkArgonne.pdf"  target="_blank">view here (4.8MB)</a>]
        <br>
        <i>Presented at Argonne National Lab, Lemont, IL, c. 2014.</i>
        <br>
        This is essentially a longer and more detailed version of the above talk, <i>A New Direction in Dark Matter Complementarity</i>, presented to Argonne National Labs theory group.
